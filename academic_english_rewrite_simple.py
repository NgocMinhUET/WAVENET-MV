    return """Traditional image compression methods optimize for human visual perception, potentially discarding information critical for machine vision tasks. We propose WAVENET-MV, a neural image compression framework designed for computer vision applications. The system combines three components: a learnable wavelet transform, an adaptive feature mixing module (AdaMixNet), and variable-rate entropy coding.

We evaluate WAVENET-MV on object detection using COCO 2017 validation images. Experimental results show 6-9% accuracy improvements over JPEG at comparable bitrates, with some trade-offs in compression efficiency. At 0.52 bits-per-pixel, WAVENET-MV achieves 77.3% mAP compared to JPEG's 67.3% mAP at 0.68 BPP, representing a 15-25% bitrate overhead for the accuracy gain.

While our approach shows promise for task-oriented compression, evaluation is limited to 1,000 images and object detection only. The method requires further validation across larger datasets and multiple vision tasks before practical deployment."""

def create_rewritten_introduction():

    return """Image compression standards like JPEG optimize for human perception, often discarding high-frequency details important for computer vision tasks. This mismatch becomes problematic in applications where compressed images feed into AI models, such as autonomous driving or video surveillance systems.

Recent neural compression methods have improved rate-distortion performance through learned transforms and adaptive entropy models. However, most approaches still optimize for perceptual quality metrics (PSNR, MS-SSIM) that may not correlate with downstream task accuracy.

We introduce WAVENET-MV, a neural compression framework that prioritizes machine vision performance over perceptual fidelity. The method consists of three stages: (1) learnable wavelet transforms (267k parameters), (2) attention-based feature mixing (AdaMixNet), and (3) variable-rate entropy coding with rate control through six lambda values.

Our contributions include: (i) a wavelet-based neural transform optimized for vision tasks, (ii) an attention mechanism that emphasizes task-relevant frequency components, and (iii) experimental validation showing 6-9% mAP improvements over JPEG on COCO object detection.

The paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews related work, Section III details our methodology, Section IV presents experimental results, and Section V concludes with limitations and future work."""

    """Create rewritten conclusion"""
    return """We presented WAVENET-MV, a neural image compression framework optimized for machine vision tasks. The approach combines learnable wavelet transforms, attention-based feature mixing, and variable-rate entropy coding to prioritize task performance over perceptual quality.

Experimental evaluation on COCO object detection shows 6-9% mAP improvements over JPEG at competitive bitrates. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of key components: learnable wavelets (+3.2% mAP), attention mechanism (+1.5% mAP), and multi-stage training (+3.8% mAP).

However, several critical limitations constrain current applicability:

\\begin{enumerate}
\\item \\textbf{Limited Scale:} Evaluation on 1,000 images from a single dataset provides preliminary evidence but insufficient validation for deployment.
\\item \\textbf{Narrow Scope:} Testing only object detection leaves performance on other vision tasks unknown.
\\item \\textbf{Computational Cost:} 4-7√ó encoding overhead and 10√ó memory usage limit practical deployment.
\\item \\textbf{Incomplete Comparison:} Limited baseline comparison with recent neural and task-oriented compression methods.
\\end{enumerate}

Future work should address these limitations through:
\\begin{itemize}
\\item Large-scale evaluation across multiple datasets (Cityscapes, ADE20K) and tasks (segmentation, tracking)
\\item Comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art neural compression methods
\\item End-to-end optimization with task networks
\\item Computational efficiency improvements for practical deployment
\\end{itemize}

While WAVENET-MV demonstrates promising preliminary results for task-oriented compression, substantial additional research is required before practical application. The work contributes to understanding trade-offs between perceptual quality and task performance in neural compression, an increasingly important area as AI systems process more compressed visual data."""
