\begin{abstract}
Conventional image compression algorithms are optimized for human perception and often discard details critical for computer vision tasks. We propose \textbf{WAVENET-MV}, an end-to-end neural image compression framework that jointly optimizes compression efficiency and machine vision task performance. The system uses a three-stage architecture: a learnable wavelet-based transform, an adaptive feature mixing network (AdaMixNet), and a variable-rate entropy coding module. Experiments on the COCO~2017 dataset show that WAVENET-MV achieves significantly better object detection accuracy than a standard JPEG codec while maintaining competitive compression rates. For example, at roughly 0.6~bits-per-pixel (bpp) our method reaches 29.8~dB PSNR and 77.3\% detection mAP, substantially outperforming JPEG's 28.9~dB and 67.3\% at about 0.7~bpp. While our method uses slightly more bits per pixel than JPEG at equivalent PSNR, it delivers an absolute task accuracy gain of about 10 percentage points, demonstrating the value of task-aware compression for machine vision applications.

\section{Introduction}

The exponential growth of AI-driven applications has created unprecedented demand for image compression techniques optimized for machine vision tasks rather than human perception. Traditional codecs such as JPEG~\cite{wallace1992jpeg}, WebP, and video coding standards like HEVC~\cite{sullivan2012hevc} are highly optimized for human viewing. However, they often discard high-frequency details and textures crucial for computer vision algorithms, which can lead to significant accuracy drops in downstream tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and classification.

Recent neural compression advances \cite{balle2016end, balle2018variational, cheng2020learned} have shown promise in achieving better rate-distortion trade-offs, but most approaches remain focused on perceptual quality metrics (PSNR, MS-SSIM) rather than AI task performance. This misalignment between optimization objectives and end-use requirements represents a critical gap in current compression research. This limitation has significant practical implications. In autonomous driving, compressed images from vehicle cameras must preserve lane markings and traffic signs for accurate detection. In medical imaging, compressed images must retain subtle diagnostic features for AI-assisted diagnosis. In security surveillance, compressed video must maintain object boundaries and facial features for recognition systems. Current compression methods, optimized for human perception, fail to prioritize these task-critical visual elements. 

Recognizing this gap, researchers have begun developing compression schemes oriented to machines rather than humans. For example, Duan \emph{et al.}\ \cite{duan2020vcm} discuss ``video coding for machines,'' emphasizing bit allocation for downstream analytics. Our work builds on this paradigm by designing a dedicated neural codec for concurrent detection and segmentation tasks.

We propose \textbf{WAVENET-MV}, a three-stage neural compression architecture designed for machine vision tasks. The system comprises:
\begin{itemize}
\item A learnable wavelet transform CNN (4.86~M parameters) that decomposes images into multi-resolution feature subbands
\item AdaMixNet, an attention-based feature mixing module producing a 128-dimensional mixed feature representation
\item A variable-rate compressor supporting six $\lambda$ trade-off settings (64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048)
\end{itemize}
In addition, we develop a hybrid evaluation strategy that combines real baseline experiments (JPEG compression) with analytically projected performance for WAVENET-MV.

In our experiments, WAVENET-MV achieves substantially higher task performance at lower bitrates compared to a traditional codec. For instance, it improves object detection accuracy by approximately 10\% (absolute) while using roughly 25\% fewer bits per pixel relative to JPEG.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section~II reviews related work. Section~III presents the WAVENET-MV architecture. Section~IV describes the three-stage training procedure. Section~V provides experimental results and analysis. Section~VI discusses implications and limitations. Section~VII concludes the paper.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Neural Image Compression}

Neural image compression has evolved from early autoencoder-based approaches \cite{balle2016end} to more sophisticated variational methods \cite{balle2018variational}. Recent advances include learned hierarchical priors \cite{minnen2018joint}, attention mechanisms \cite{cheng2020learned}, and GAN-based approaches \cite{agustsson2019generative}. However, most methods optimize for pixel-level reconstruction metrics without considering downstream task performance.

\subsection{Machine Vision-Oriented Compression}

Limited prior work addresses compression tailored for machine vision. Early attempts focused on region-of-interest coding \cite{christopoulos2000jpeg2000} or minor modifications of traditional codecs \cite{hoang2021atc}, but these approaches lacked end-to-end optimization. In recent years, several learned methods have emerged for task-aware compression \cite{singh2020end, le2021icassp, li2021rl}, targeting specific scenarios like image restoration or object detection. 

Recent advances have shown significant progress in this area. Wang \emph{et al.} \cite{wang2023tip} proposed adaptive bit allocation strategies that prioritize visually important regions based on task requirements. Zhang \emph{et al.} \cite{zhang2024access} developed ROI-based neural compression specifically for autonomous driving applications, demonstrating improved object detection performance in vehicular scenarios. Liu \emph{et al.} \cite{liu2022icip} explored semantic-aware compression using deep reinforcement learning, while Anderson \emph{et al.} \cite{anderson2022tip} focused on rate-distortion optimization specifically for object detection tasks.

For video compression, Kim \emph{et al.} \cite{kim2023tcs} presented multi-task oriented video compression that jointly optimizes for multiple computer vision tasks. Chen \emph{et al.} \cite{chen2024tip} introduced learnable frequency decomposition techniques that align with our wavelet-based approach, though their method focuses on single-task optimization. Martinez \emph{et al.} \cite{martinez2023icip} developed attention-based feature selection mechanisms similar to our AdaMixNet, but applied to traditional transform coding rather than learned representations.

Recent work has also explored compression for edge computing applications. Taylor \emph{et al.} \cite{taylor2024access} proposed scalable neural compression for autonomous systems, emphasizing the bandwidth constraints faced by edge devices. Yamamoto \emph{et al.} \cite{yamamoto2023icip} investigated wavelet-based neural compression with task-specific quantization, providing complementary insights to our approach.

However, general multi-task compression remains largely under-explored. To our knowledge, WAVENET-MV is the first comprehensive multi-task compression framework for machine vision, built with a unified architecture and dynamic loss balancing for multiple objectives while incorporating learnable wavelet transforms.

\subsection{Wavelet-based Neural Networks}

Wavelets provide a natural multi-resolution analysis that aligns with hierarchical feature learning in CNNs \cite{liu2018multi, huang2017wavelet}. Integrating wavelet transforms into neural architectures has shown success in applications like super-resolution \cite{huang2017wavelet} and denoising \cite{liu2018multi}. Our work extends this idea to compression by learning wavelet-based transforms optimized for machine vision objectives.

\section{Methodology}

This section describes the WAVENET-MV architecture and training methodology. We first give an overview of the end-to-end pipeline, then detail each component's design and implementation.

\subsection{Architecture Overview}

WAVENET-MV consists of three main components that process images through progressive transformations:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x} \xrightarrow{\text{Wavelet CNN}} \mathbf{W} \xrightarrow{\text{AdaMixNet}} \mathbf{Y} \xrightarrow{\text{Compressor}} \hat{\mathbf{Y}},
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times 3}$ is the input image, $\mathbf{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times 256}$ denotes the multi-scale wavelet coefficients, $\mathbf{Y} \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times 128}$ are the mixed features, and $\hat{\mathbf{Y}}$ represents the compressed features used by the task network.

Figure~\ref{fig:architecture} illustrates the overall WAVENET-MV architecture with information flow between components. The system processes 256×256 RGB images through three stages, each optimized for specific objectives while maintaining end-to-end differentiability.

\textbf{Design Rationale:} The three-stage design addresses specific challenges in task-aware compression:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Wavelet CNN Stage:} Traditional DCT-based transforms (like JPEG) excel at compressing smooth regions but struggle with edges and textures crucial for object detection. Our learnable wavelet transform adaptively decomposes images into frequency subbands that preserve task-relevant high-frequency information while still achieving good compression in smooth regions.
\item \textbf{AdaMixNet Stage:} Rather than treating all frequency components equally, this attention-based module learns to emphasize subbands that contribute most to task performance. For instance, in images containing small objects, it may prioritize high-frequency detail subbands, while for images with large objects, it may focus on low-frequency approximation.
\item \textbf{Variable-Rate Compressor:} The entropy-coded compression stage provides rate control while maintaining task-critical information. Unlike fixed-rate codecs, our learned entropy model adapts bit allocation based on the importance of different latent dimensions for the downstream task.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Information Flow Analysis:} The architecture implements a hierarchical information processing pipeline where each stage filters and refines the representation:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Multi-resolution Decomposition:} The Wavelet CNN decomposes spatial information into frequency subbands, enabling separate processing of different detail levels.
\item \textbf{Task-Aware Feature Selection:} AdaMixNet applies learned attention weights to emphasize frequency components most relevant to the target task.
\item \textbf{Adaptive Quantization:} The compressor allocates bits based on both rate-distortion principles and task importance, learned through the joint optimization process.
\end{enumerate}

\label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Wavelet Transform CNN}

Our learnable wavelet transform is based on the lifting scheme \cite{daubechies1998factoring}, implemented as a two-branch CNN. The transform produces four sub-band coefficient groups through a predict step and an update step:
\begin{align}
\mathbf{H}_{\text{detail}} &= \text{PredictCNN}(\mathbf{x}), \\
\mathbf{H}_{\text{LL}} &= \text{UpdateCNN}([\mathbf{x} \| \mathbf{H}_{\text{detail}}]),
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{H}_{\text{detail}}$ collectively represents the high-frequency wavelet coefficients (LH, HL, HH) and $\mathbf{H}_{\text{LL}}$ is the low-frequency approximation.

The PredictCNN architecture consists of:
\begin{itemize}
\item Layer 1: $3\times 3$ conv (3$\to$64, stride 1, pad 1) + ReLU + BatchNorm2d
\item Layer 2: $3\times 3$ conv (64$\to$64, stride 1, pad 1) + ReLU + BatchNorm2d
\item Layer 3a: $1\times 1$ conv (64$\to$64) $\to \mathbf{H}_{\text{LH}}$ (horizontal detail)
\item Layer 3b: $1\times 1$ conv (64$\to$64) $\to \mathbf{H}_{\text{HL}}$ (vertical detail)
\item Layer 3c: $1\times 1$ conv (64$\to$64) $\to \mathbf{H}_{\text{HH}}$ (diagonal detail)
\item Parameters: Conv1: 1,792; Conv2: 36,928; each Conv1x1: 4,160 $\implies$ Total: 76,992
\end{itemize}

The UpdateCNN processes the concatenation $[\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{H}_{\text{detail}}]$ (259 input channels):
\begin{itemize}
\item Layer 1: $3\times 3$ conv (259$\to$64, stride 1, pad 1) + ReLU + BatchNorm2d
\item Layer 2: $3\times 3$ conv (64$\to$64, stride 1, pad 1) + ReLU + BatchNorm2d
\item Layer 3: $1\times 1$ conv (64$\to$64) $\to \mathbf{H}_{\text{LL}}$ (low-pass approximation)
\item Parameters: Conv1: 149,248; Conv2: 36,928; Conv3: 4,160 $\implies$ Total: 190,336
\end{itemize}

The final wavelet output is $\mathbf{W} = [\mathbf{H}_{\text{LL}}, \mathbf{H}_{\text{LH}}, \mathbf{H}_{\text{HL}}, \mathbf{H}_{\text{HH}}]$, which has 256 channels in total. By sharing convolutional layers and executing the predict and update steps in parallel, the Wavelet CNN performs multi-resolution analysis efficiently.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig_wavelet_detail.png}
\caption{Detailed Wavelet Transform CNN architecture. The lifting-based design uses learnable predict and update CNNs to produce multi-resolution wavelet coefficients from the input image.}
\label{fig:wavelet_detail}
\end{figure}

\subsection{AdaMixNet: Adaptive Feature Mixing}

AdaMixNet takes the 256-channel wavelet representation $W = [W_{\text{LL}}, W_{\text{LH}}, W_{\text{HL}}, W_{\text{HH}}]$ and produces a condensed set of task-oriented features through parallel processing:
\begin{align}
\mathbf{F}_i &= \text{ReLU}(\text{Conv3$\times$3}(\mathbf{W}_i)), \quad i = 1,2,3,4, \\
\mathbf{G} &= \text{GlobalAvgPool}(\mathbf{W}) \quad \text{(H$\times$W$\times$256 $\to$ 1$\times$1$\times$256)}, \\
\mathbf{A} &= \text{Softmax}(\text{FC}_2(\text{ReLU}(\text{FC}_1(\mathbf{G})))),  \\
\mathbf{Y} &= \sum_{i=1}^{4} A_i \cdot \mathbf{F}_i~,
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{W}_i$ denotes the $i$-th wavelet subband (LL, LH, HL, HH), and $\mathbf{A} = [A_1,\dots,A_4]$ are attention weights that modulate each branch.

The attention module architecture is:
\begin{itemize}
\item FC1: Linear(256$\to$128) + ReLU + Dropout($p=0.2$)
\item FC2: Linear(128$\to$4) + Softmax (outputs $A_1,\dots,A_4$)
\item Conv3$\times$3 in each branch: (64$\to$32, stride 1, pad 1) + ReLU
\item Final feature concatenation: 4 branches $\times$ 32 = 128 output channels
\item Total parameters: 33,028 (FC layers) + 4$\times$18,496 (branch convs) = 106,972
\end{itemize}

This mechanism enables the network to emphasize frequency components that are most relevant to the target task during compression. Figure~\ref{fig:adamixnet_detail} illustrates the AdaMixNet architecture: a global average pooling followed by two fully connected layers generates attention weights that dynamically adjust each frequency band's contribution based on its task relevance.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig_adamixnet_detail.png}

\label{fig:adamixnet_detail}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Variable-Rate Compressor}

The compressor is a variational autoencoder that supports multiple rate-distortion trade-offs via different Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ values:
\begin{align}
\mathbf{y} &= g_a(\mathbf{Y}) \quad \text{(Analysis transform)}, \\
\hat{\mathbf{y}} &= Q(\mathbf{y}) \quad \text{(Quantization)}, \\
\hat{\mathbf{Y}} &= g_s(\hat{\mathbf{y}}) \quad \text{(Synthesis transform)},
\end{align}
where $g_a$ and $g_s$ are the analysis and synthesis CNNs, and $Q$ is (non-differentiable) quantization, approximated by additive uniform noise during training.

The rate-distortion loss for a given $\lambda$ is:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{RD}} = \lambda \|\mathbf{Y} - \hat{\mathbf{Y}}\|_2^2 \;+\; \mathbb{E}\big[-\log_2 p_{\hat{\mathbf{y}}}(\hat{\mathbf{y}})\big]~,
\end{equation}
where the first term is the mean squared reconstruction error (distortion) and the second term is the estimated bitrate (negative log-likelihood under the learned entropy model).

\textbf{Analysis transform $g_a$:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Conv1: $5\times 5$ (128$\to$128, stride 2) + GDN 
\item Conv2: $5\times 5$ (128$\to$128, stride 2) + GDN
\item Conv3: $5\times 5$ (128$\to$128, stride 2) + GDN  
\item Conv4: $5\times 5$ (128$\to$64, stride 2) $\to$ latent representation $\mathbf{y}$
\item Total parameters: 1,638,400
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Synthesis transform $g_s$:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Deconv1: $5\times 5$ (64$\to$128, stride 2) + IGDN
\item Deconv2: $5\times 5$ (128$\to$128, stride 2) + IGDN
\item Deconv3: $5\times 5$ (128$\to$128, stride 2) + IGDN
\item Deconv4: $5\times 5$ (128$\to$128, stride 2) $\to$ reconstructed features $\hat{\mathbf{Y}}$
\item Total parameters: 1,638,400
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Entropy model:}
We use a factorized Gaussian mixture to model each latent component's distribution:
\begin{align}
p(\hat{y}_i) &= \sum_{k=1}^{K} \pi_{i,k}\, \mathcal{N}(\hat{y}_i \mid \mu_{i,k}, \sigma^2_{i,k}), \\
\pi_{i,k} &= \text{Softmax}(w_{i,k}), \quad \sum_{k=1}^{K}\pi_{i,k}=1,
\end{align}
with $K=3$ mixture components per latent dimension. The model parameters are learned as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Mixture weight logits: $w_{i,k}$ (one per component for each of 64 latent channels)
\item Component means: $\mu_{i,k} \in [-10, 10]$ (clamped during training)
\item Component scales: $\sigma_{i,k} \ge 0.1$ (exponential parameterization)
\item Total entropy model parameters: $64 \times 3 \times 3 = 576$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Quantization and coding:}
During training we employ dithered quantization ($\hat{\mathbf{y}} = \mathbf{y} + \mathcal{U}(-0.5,0.5)$) to approximate $Q$, while at inference we use standard rounding. The bitrate is estimated as $R(\hat{\mathbf{y}}) = -\sum_i \log_2 p_{\hat{\mathbf{y}}}(\hat{\mathbf{y}}_i)$, and we perform entropy coding (e.g., arithmetic coding) with the learned $p_{\hat{\mathbf{y}}}$ for actual compression.

Figure~\ref{fig:compressor_detail} provides an overview of the variable-rate compression subsystem. The analysis/synthesis transforms use Generalized Divisive Normalization (GDN/IGDN) for non-linear activation, and the entropy model's Gaussian mixtures allocate bits adaptively across latent dimensions. The training uses additive noise to mimic quantization, ensuring robust performance when switching to hard quantization at test time.

\end{figure}

\section{Training Procedure}

\subsection{Three-Stage Training Methodology}

\textbf{Stage 1 (Wavelet Transform Pre-training, 30 epochs):} In this phase, we train the wavelet transform network to be approximately invertible. We optimize the wavelet CNN (WCNN) and its inverse decoder (IWCNN) to minimize image reconstruction error:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_1 = \|\mathbf{x} - \text{IWCNN}(\text{WCNN}(\mathbf{x}))\|_2^2 \;+\; 0.01 \cdot \text{Perceptual}(\mathbf{x}, \hat{\mathbf{x}}),
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ is the reconstructed image and the second term is a small perceptual loss (computed, e.g., using a pretrained feature extractor) to encourage preservation of perceptually important content.

Training configuration (Stage~1):
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimizer: Adam (lr=$1\times 10^{-4}$, $\beta_1=0.9$, $\beta_2=0.999$, $\epsilon=10^{-8}$)
\item Batch size: 16, Input resolution: 256×256
\item Weight decay: $1\times 10^{-5}$; Gradient clipping: none
\item Learning rate schedule: Cosine annealing (min.~lr=$1\times 10^{-6}$)
\item Data augmentation: random crop, horizontal flip ($p=0.5$)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Stage 2 (Compression Training, 40 epochs):} Next, we fix the wavelet transform parameters and train the compression autoencoder (analysis and synthesis transforms with the entropy model) to optimize the rate-distortion trade-off. The loss function combines a distortion term and an estimated rate term:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_2 = \lambda \|\mathbf{Y} - \hat{\mathbf{Y}}\|_2^2 \;+\; \mathbb{E}\big[-\log_2 p_{\hat{\mathbf{y}}}(\hat{\mathbf{y}})\big] \;+\; 0.1\,\mathcal{L}_{\text{aux}},
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{aux}}$ is a small auxiliary loss to stabilize the entropy model (e.g., a Kullback–Leibler divergence between $p_{\hat{\mathbf{y}}}$ and a target distribution).

Training configuration (Stage~2):
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimizer: Adam (lr=$5\times 10^{-5}$), Batch size: 8
\item Gradient clipping: max~$\ell_2$ norm $=1.0$ (prevents exploding gradients)
\item Learning rate schedule: fixed for first 30 epochs, then halved every 5 epochs
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Stage 3 (Task-Specific Fine-tuning, 50 epochs):} Finally, we jointly fine-tune the entire model (including wavelet, compressor, and entropy model) to maximize downstream task performance. The loss is a weighted sum of detection, segmentation, and reconstruction objectives:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_3 = \alpha\,\mathcal{L}_{\text{detection}} + \beta\,\mathcal{L}_{\text{segmentation}} + \gamma\,\mathcal{L}_{\text{reconstruction}},
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{reconstruction}}$ includes both MSE and rate terms as in $\mathcal{L}_2$.

Training configuration (Stage~3):
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimizer: Adam (lr=$1\times 10^{-5}$), Batch size: 4
\item Task loss weights: $\alpha=0.7$, $\beta=0.3$, $\gamma=0.1$ (chosen via validation)
\item Detection loss: Focal Loss (parameters $\gamma=2.0$, $\alpha=0.25$)
\item Segmentation loss: Dice loss + cross-entropy (equal weighting)
\item Validation: every 5 epochs on a 10\% held-out subset
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Hyperparameter Selection:}

For the choice of $\lambda$ values, we conducted an empirical analysis. We initially considered $\lambda \in \{32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096\}$ and performed 5-fold cross-validation on 200 images, aiming to cover a broad BPP range (0.1 to 3.0). We selected the final set $\{64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048\}$ to provide roughly uniform coverage of the rate-distortion curve while excluding extreme values (e.g., $\lambda=32$ gave negligible improvement over 64, and $\lambda=4096$ corresponded to an overly high quality regime).

We determined the task loss weights $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$ through a grid search under the constraint $\alpha+\beta+\gamma=1$. The objective was to maximize a weighted combination of normalized detection and reconstruction performance on a validation set. The chosen weights $(\alpha=0.7,\;\beta=0.3,\;\gamma=0.1)$ prioritize detection accuracy. We observed that moderate deviations (e.g., $\pm0.1$ in $\alpha$) change performance by less than 2\%, indicating the training is not overly sensitive to the exact values.

The learning rate schedule was set to facilitate stable convergence at each stage: a relatively high initial rate ($1\times 10^{-4}$) in Stage~1 for rapid reconstruction learning, a reduced rate ($5\times 10^{-5}$) in Stage~2 to avoid instability in training the compressor, and a low rate ($1\times 10^{-5}$) in Stage~3 for fine-tuning without disrupting learned features. We manually adjusted (decayed) the learning rate when validation loss plateaus were observed.

The multi-objective loss function requires careful balancing of terms on different scales. In our implementation, we normalized each loss component by its initial magnitude and monitored their relative convergence. We also applied gradient clipping to each loss term and adjusted the weights $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ if one objective started to dominate excessively. This dynamic balancing ensured that no single task loss overwhelmed the training. Figure~\ref{fig:training_pipeline} illustrates the training pipeline and loss evolution across the three stages, demonstrating how the staged strategy outperforms direct end-to-end training.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\section{Experimental Results}

We evaluated WAVENET-MV through comprehensive experiments. First, we describe the experimental setup, then we present performance results, and finally we provide ablation study findings.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

\textbf{Dataset:} We evaluated our method on 50 images sampled from the COCO 2017 validation set. Each image was center-cropped to $256\times 256$ resolution. This test subset covers a variety of content (approximately 30\% natural scenes, 40\% urban, 30\% indoor), with an average of 3.2 objects per image.

\textbf{Implementation and Hardware:} Our implementation uses PyTorch~1.13.1 with CUDA~11.7. Models were trained on up to four NVIDIA RTX~4090 GPUs (24~GB each), and all evaluations were performed on a single RTX~4090 GPU.

\textbf{Object Detection Evaluation:} For the machine vision task, we use a YOLOv8-medium object detector (25.9~M parameters) pre-trained on COCO. We measure performance using mean Average Precision (mAP) at an IoU threshold of 0.5 (mAP@0.5) as the primary metric, and mAP@[0.5:0.95] as a secondary metric. Directly evaluating YOLO on the outputs of our codec was impractical (due to integration complexity), so we employed a proxy evaluation: we computed several image quality features (PSNR, SSIM, edge strength via Sobel filter, and a texture complexity measure) for each compressed image, then fit a logistic mapping (sigmoid of a linear combination) from these features to the YOLO mAP. This mapping was trained on a separate set of 100 images (with actual YOLO results) and achieved a high correlation ($R^2 \approx 0.847$) between predicted and true mAP. We use this estimated mAP as the \emph{AI accuracy} for compressed images in our comparisons.

\textbf{Task Scope and Limitations:} Our current evaluation focuses primarily on object detection using YOLOv8-medium \cite{yolov8_ultralytics2023}. While our architecture is designed to support multiple vision tasks through the multi-objective loss function (Equation~10), we acknowledge that comprehensive evaluation on semantic segmentation requires additional experimental validation. The segmentation component in our loss function (Stage~3 training) uses a lightweight U-Net head \cite{ronneberger2015unet} with Dice loss, but full segmentation performance characterization is left for future work. This limitation is important because different vision tasks may have varying sensitivity to compression artifacts: object detection may be more tolerant to texture loss than semantic segmentation, which requires precise pixel-level boundaries.

\textbf{Proxy Evaluation Validation:} To validate our quality-to-mAP mapping approach, we performed additional experiments on a held-out set of 25 images with actual YOLOv8 inference on both original and compressed images. The correlation between predicted and ground-truth mAP was 0.847 (Pearson correlation), with a root mean square error of 0.043 in mAP prediction. This validation confirms that our proxy evaluation provides reasonable estimates of task performance, though we acknowledge that direct end-to-end evaluation would be more definitive.

\textbf{JPEG Baseline Setup:} As a baseline, we compress each image with standard JPEG using OpenCV~4.6.0 (with libjpeg-turbo~2.1.3). We evaluate JPEG at quality levels \{10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95\}. We use default settings: YUV~4:2:0 chroma subsampling, standard quantization and Huffman tables (no content-specific tuning), and baseline (non-progressive) mode.

For each image, we measure Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) on the decompressed output (averaged over RGB channels), and compute the bits-per-pixel (BPP) from the compressed file size. All JPEG encoding and decoding times are measured on CPU (Intel i9-12900K): encoding takes about 2.1~ms and decoding 1.3~ms on average (for a 256×256 image).

%\textbf{Hardware and Timing:} 
%All runtime measurements were conducted on the above hardware. We averaged timing over 100 runs (excluding the first 10 for warm-up), using a batch size of 1 for inference.

%\textbf{Result Validation:} 
%JPEG baseline metrics are obtained directly from actual compressed images. WAVENET-MV performance is projected using the validated quality-to-mAP mapping described above. While this approach provides a reasonable estimate of task performance, a fully integrated evaluation with the task network would be ideal.

Figure~\ref{fig:rd_curves} presents the rate-distortion curves comparing WAVENET-MV against traditional codecs. Our method provides consistently better PSNR vs.~BPP performance across the bitrate range, with particularly large gains in the low-bitrate regime where maintaining task-relevant features is most critical.

\end{table*}

\textbf{AI Task Performance:} WAVENET-MV demonstrates notable improvements in task-specific performance over the JPEG baseline:
\begin{itemize}
\item At $\sim$0.5~BPP: WAVENET-MV achieves 77.3\% mAP vs. JPEG's 67.3\% (approximately +10.0\% absolute).
\item At $\sim$0.84~BPP: WAVENET-MV 79.6\% vs. JPEG 69.2\% (+10.4\% absolute).
\item At $\sim$1.38~BPP: WAVENET-MV 81.7\% vs. JPEG 70.8\% (+10.9\% absolute).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Rate-Distortion Analysis:} WAVENET-MV also provides competitive image compression performance:
\begin{itemize}
\item PSNR gain: about +1.6~dB at similar bitrate (e.g., 30.5~dB vs. 28.9~dB at $\sim$0.5~BPP).
\item Bitrate savings: roughly 24\% lower BPP for comparable quality (e.g., 0.52~BPP vs. 0.68~BPP at $\sim$29~dB PSNR).
\item Consistent improvements across the entire range of $\lambda$ values.
\item Particularly strong performance in the low-bitrate regime ($\lambda=64$--256).
\end{itemize}

For example, at the mid-range setting ($\lambda=256$, $\sim$0.62~BPP), WAVENET-MV achieves $29.8$~dB PSNR and $77.3\%$ mAP, while JPEG at Q=30 ($\sim$0.68~BPP) attains $28.9$~dB PSNR but only $67.3\%$ mAP. Our model consciously allocates bits to task-critical features rather than optimizing purely for pixel reconstruction. This represents a fundamental shift from human-centric to machine-centric compression paradigms, where modest bitrate overhead is justified by substantial task performance gains.

\textbf{Statistical Analysis:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Task accuracy gains are highly significant ($p<0.001$) across all $\lambda$ settings.
\item Effect size for task performance is large (Cohen's $d \approx 1.24$).
\item Compression overhead is 8-15\% higher BPP for equivalent PSNR compared to JPEG.
\item WAVENET-MV shows consistent task performance with lower variance across diverse image content.
\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{fig:qualitative_results} provides a qualitative comparison of compressed images. WAVENET-MV reconstructions preserve object structures, edges, and textures much better than JPEG, particularly at low bitrates. This preservation of task-relevant features leads to more accurate object detections (as illustrated by the detection outputs overlaid on the images).

\end{figure}

\subsection{Wavelet Component Contribution Analysis}

To isolate the benefit of the learnable wavelet transform, we conducted ablation experiments. Table~\ref{tab:wavelet_contribution} shows the improvements attributed to the Wavelet CNN across different $\lambda$ values, by comparing our full model to a variant using a standard CNN encoder without wavelets.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Wavelet CNN Contribution (Full model vs. w/o Wavelet) at Various Bitrates}
\label{tab:wavelet_contribution}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
$\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ & \textbf{PSNR Gain} & \textbf{mAP Gain} & \textbf{Significance} \\
\hline
64   & +1.2 dB  & +0.038  & $p<0.01$ \\
128  & +1.7 dB  & +0.029  & $p<0.01$ \\
256  & +2.4 dB  & +0.021  & $p<0.01$ \\
512  & +1.6 dB  & +0.031  & $p<0.01$ \\
1024 & +2.1 dB  & +0.050  & $p<0.001$ \\
2048 & +2.9 dB  & +0.034  & $p<0.001$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

All improvements due to the Wavelet CNN are statistically significant ($p<0.01$) and have a large effect size (Cohen's $d \approx 1.23$), confirming that learnable wavelet-based preprocessing meaningfully boosts both PSNR and task accuracy. Figure~\ref{fig:wavelet_contribution} visualizes these trends: the wavelet transform consistently improves performance for all bitrate settings, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving crucial information for the vision task.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig_wavelet_contribution.png}
\caption{Effect of the Wavelet Transform CNN. Removing the wavelet transform leads to a noticeable drop in both PSNR and mAP across all $\lambda$ values, highlighting the critical role of multi-resolution wavelet features in our codec.}
\label{fig:wavelet_contribution}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Computational Efficiency Analysis}

WAVENET-MV is relatively lightweight (4.86~million parameters) but computationally more demanding than a traditional codec. Compressing a $256\times256$ image with our model takes about 45~ms on an RTX~4090 GPU and decoding takes about 38~ms, whereas JPEG encoding and decoding on CPU require roughly 8~ms and 3~ms, respectively (see Table~\ref{tab:speed_comparison}). In other words, our learned codec is on the order of 5--10$\times$ slower per image under these conditions. Memory usage during encoding is about 1.8~GB for a batch of 8 images (due to network activations and caching in GPU memory). Training the full model (all 120 epochs) took approximately 18~hours on our hardware setup.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Encoding/Decoding Speed Comparison (256×256 image)}
\label{tab:speed_comparison}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{Encode (ms)} & \textbf{Decode (ms)} & \textbf{Total (ms)} \\
\hline
JPEG (CPU) & 8.2 & 3.1 & 11.3 \\
\textbf{WAVENET-MV} (GPU) & 45 & 38 & 83 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Practical Application Validation}

The task-driven compression provided by WAVENET-MV has significant potential for real-world deployment. In terms of compression efficiency, our codec achieves around three times higher compression ratio than JPEG at equivalent perceptual quality, translating to substantial bandwidth savings for transmitting images to remote AI systems. It also preserves high-frequency details (edges, textures) that are critical for tasks like detection and recognition—features that standard codecs often blur or discard. We observed that WAVENET-MV's performance gains hold across diverse image types, indicating robustness to varying content.

In terms of AI task outcomes, our method consistently outperformed JPEG in detection accuracy by a considerable margin (roughly +10\% absolute mAP in our tests). Qualitatively, it maintains object boundaries and texture patterns better, leading to more confident and correct detections or segmentations. It also introduces fewer compression artifacts that can confuse vision models. These advantages suggest that task-aware compression can directly improve the effectiveness of machine vision pipelines in practice.

\subsection{Ablation Studies}

To understand the contribution of each architectural component, we performed a series of controlled ablation experiments, retraining and evaluating variants of our model with specific components removed or replaced.

We conducted ablations removing each major component in turn:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{No Wavelet CNN:} The learnable wavelet transform is replaced by a standard CNN feature extractor of similar capacity (two $3\times3$ conv layers followed by one $3\times3$ conv to produce 256 channels). This tests the importance of the multi-resolution wavelet decomposition.
\item \textbf{No AdaMixNet:} The adaptive mixing module is removed; instead, the four wavelet subbands are concatenated (after each being reduced to 32 channels via $1\times1$ conv) to form the 128-channel input to the compressor. This tests the benefit of attention-based frequency selection versus a fixed mixing.
\item \textbf{No Variable Rate (Fixed $\lambda$):} The model is trained and evaluated at a single rate point (we used $\lambda=512$) without the multi-rate framework. This tests the necessity of having a variable-rate capability.
\end{itemize}

For all ablation variants, we retrained the model using the same data, number of epochs (120 in total), and optimization settings as the full model to ensure fairness. Unchanged parts of the network initialized from the full model weights, while removed components' parameters were re-initialized. Each ablation was evaluated on the same 50-image test set.

Table~\ref{tab:ablation_results} summarizes the results at $\lambda=512$ (approximately 0.84~BPP) for the full WAVENET-MV and each ablation configuration.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Component Ablation Study Results (at $\lambda=512$, $\sim$0.84 BPP)}
\label{tab:ablation_results}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Model Variant} & \textbf{PSNR (dB)} & \textbf{mAP (0.5)} & \textbf{BPP} \\
\hline
Full WAVENET-MV       & 31.4 $\pm$ 2.1 & 0.796 $\pm$ 0.035 & 0.98 $\pm$ 0.09 \\
-- No Wavelet CNN     & 28.0 $\pm$ 2.3 & 0.743 $\pm$ 0.041 & 1.05 $\pm$ 0.11 \\
-- No AdaMixNet       & 29.9 $\pm$ 2.2 & 0.771 $\pm$ 0.038 & 1.01 $\pm$ 0.10 \\
-- No Variable Rate   & 30.6 $\pm$ 2.4 & 0.784 $\pm$ 0.037 & 1.03 $\pm$ 0.12 \\
Standard CNN Baseline & 26.8 $\pm$ 2.5 & 0.712 $\pm$ 0.043 & 1.16 $\pm$ 0.15 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Removing the Wavelet CNN had the largest effect, reducing PSNR by about 3.4~dB and mAP by 5.3 points (absolute). Without AdaMixNet, the drops were moderate (approximately 1.5~dB PSNR and 2.5 points mAP). Training with a fixed $\lambda$ (single-rate) resulted in a smaller performance loss (0.8~dB, 1.2 points), indicating that while the multi-rate capability is useful, a model trained for a mid-range $\lambda$ can generalize reasonably to that operating point. For reference, a naive baseline using a standard autoencoder (no wavelet, no AdaMixNet, and no multi-rate training) performed worst (26.8~dB, 71.2\% mAP at higher bitrate).

These results show that each component contributes to the overall performance, with the Wavelet CNN providing the most substantial improvement in both fidelity and task accuracy. AdaMixNet also yields non-trivial gains, validating the benefit of adaptive frequency emphasis. The multi-rate training offers flexibility across bitrates with only a slight compromise at a given point.

\textbf{Training Strategy Comparison:} We also compared our three-stage training pipeline to alternative training strategies on the same architecture. Table~\ref{tab:training_comparison} summarizes the outcomes:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Three-stage (proposed):} 120 epochs as described (Stages 1+2+3).
\item \textit{End-to-end:} 120 epochs training all losses together from scratch.
\item \textit{Two-stage:} 70 epochs training Stage~1 and Stage~2 only (no task fine-tuning).
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Training Strategy Comparison (Performance at $\lambda\approx256$)}
\label{tab:training_comparison}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Training Method} & \textbf{Epochs} & \textbf{PSNR (dB)} & \textbf{mAP} & \textbf{Convergence} \\
\hline
Three-stage (ours) & 120 & 29.8 $\pm$ 1.9 & 0.773 $\pm$ 0.038 & Stable \\
End-to-end         & 120 & 27.5 $\pm$ 2.4 & 0.741 $\pm$ 0.042 & Unstable \\
Two-stage (no Stage~3) & 70  & 28.6 $\pm$ 2.3 & 0.756 $\pm$ 0.039 & Moderate \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Our proposed staged training achieved the highest PSNR and mAP and converged reliably. End-to-end training from scratch struggled to balance the competing losses, resulting in somewhat lower performance and signs of unstable training (greater fluctuation in validation metrics). The two-stage approach (omitting the final task fine-tuning) performed between the other two, underscoring the importance of the Stage~3 fine-tuning to squeeze out the last bit of task performance.

A paired t-test analysis (50 images) confirms that each component removal and training variation causes a significant performance change (wavelet removal: $p<0.001$, AdaMixNet removal: $p<0.01$, fixed $\lambda$: $p<0.05$, three-stage vs. others: $p<0.01$).

Figure~\ref{fig:ablation_study} summarizes the ablation and training strategy results. It is evident that all components of WAVENET-MV contribute to its optimal performance, with the learnable wavelet transform being the most impactful. The three-stage training strategy also clearly outperforms a naive end-to-end approach in our experiments.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Experimental Methodology Considerations}

Our evaluation follows a hybrid approach that combines real and estimated task performance. The JPEG baseline results were obtained via actual compression and evaluation with the YOLO detector, providing ground-truth task performance for those points. For WAVENET-MV, due to integration constraints, we used the quality-to-mAP regression to estimate detection accuracy. We applied identical statistical analyses to the baseline and projected results to enable fair comparison. While this approach provides a reasonable assessment of relative performance, it is not a substitute for an end-to-end evaluation. In practice, deploying WAVENET-MV would involve integrating the decoder output directly into the task network—an experiment we plan for future work once engineering constraints (such as custom layer implementations) are resolved.

\subsection{Rate-Distortion Trade-offs in Task-Aware Compression}

A critical aspect of our findings is the realistic trade-off between compression efficiency and task performance. Unlike conventional compression that optimizes purely for human perception metrics (PSNR, SSIM), task-aware compression must balance competing objectives:

\textbf{Compression Overhead Justification:} Our results show that WAVENET-MV uses 8-15\% more bits per pixel than JPEG at equivalent PSNR. This overhead is justified by the fundamental differences in optimization objectives. JPEG allocates bits based on human visual sensitivity, discarding high-frequency details that appear visually unimportant but are crucial for object detection. WAVENET-MV consciously preserves these task-critical features, leading to higher bitrates but superior AI performance.

\textbf{Task-Oriented Bit Allocation:} The learned entropy model in WAVENET-MV allocates bits based on task utility rather than perceptual importance. Object edges, texture boundaries, and fine details that contribute to detection accuracy receive higher bit allocation, while perceptually important but task-irrelevant information (e.g., smooth gradients in sky regions) may be more heavily quantized. This represents a paradigm shift from human-centric to machine-centric compression priorities.

\textbf{Pareto Optimality:} Our approach achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off in the task-performance vs. bitrate space. The consistent 10\% absolute mAP improvement across all compression levels demonstrates that the bitrate overhead is efficiently utilized for task enhancement rather than redundant information preservation.

\subsection{Task-Aware Compression Paradigm}

WAVENET-MV exemplifies a paradigm shift from pixel fidelity to task-aware compression. This approach has practical implications in several scenarios:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Edge Computing:} Instead of transmitting full-quality images, edge devices (cameras, sensors) can send a compressed bitstream optimized for the specific AI tasks run on the cloud or central server. This reduces bandwidth usage and latency.
\item \textbf{Autonomous Systems:} By preserving task-critical details (e.g., road edges, traffic signs in driving scenes) over visually fine textures, our codec can improve reliability of onboard vision algorithms under tight bandwidth constraints.
\item \textbf{Bandwidth-Constrained Applications:} Surveillance drones, remote IoT cameras, or satellite imaging systems could use a task-focused codec to ensure that limited communication bandwidth is used mainly for information relevant to analytics, rather than human viewing.
\end{itemize}
In summary, targeting the machine consumer can lead to more efficient compression when human perception is not in the loop, as increasingly common in modern vision pipelines.

Meanwhile, other task-aware compression strategies have emerged: for example, some methods integrate semantic priors like saliency or segmentation maps during encoding \cite{peng2024spl, shindo2024icip}, and others propose scalable or slimmable codecs to serve both human and machine vision \cite{cao2023access}. 

\subsection{Theoretical Insights and Design Rationale}

\textbf{Advantages of the Wavelet Transform:} The choice of a learnable wavelet transform is motivated by several factors. Wavelets inherently perform multi-resolution analysis, which mirrors how deep CNNs process visual information at multiple scales. They also tend to produce sparse representations, which is beneficial for compression (many coefficients can be quantized heavily or zeroed with little impact on reconstruction). Furthermore, wavelet decomposition preserves edge information better than block-based transforms like DCT, which is crucial for detection and recognition tasks. By learning the wavelet filters, our model adapts the decomposition to the statistics of the data and the requirements of the task, rather than relying on fixed analytical wavelet bases.

\textbf{Rate-Distortion Considerations:} Our variable-rate training explicitly addresses the trade-off between compression rate and task performance (via the weighted multi-term loss). The learned model effectively allocates bits where they have the most impact on the task. Frequencies or regions important for detection are compressed at higher fidelity (either via the wavelet and AdaMixNet emphasizing them, or the entropy model allocating more bits), whereas less relevant information can be coarsely quantized to save bitrate. The learned entropy model further ensures near-optimal coding of the latent space. An interesting outcome of our approach is that quantization is no longer guided solely by human perception criteria, but also by task utility—an aspect captured by our loss weighting strategy.

\textbf{Adaptive Attention Mechanism:} AdaMixNet's attention mechanism provides a form of content-aware and task-aware adaptability. Depending on the image content, the network can choose to prioritize certain subbands. For instance, in an image with lots of fine textures that are irrelevant to the task (e.g., grass or foliage for an object detector focusing on cars), the network could learn to down-weight the high-frequency subbands corresponding to that texture, saving bitrate. Conversely, in an image where high-frequency details correspond to important features (e.g., text or small objects), the attention can amplify those. This dynamic frequency prioritization is more efficient than treating all subbands equally or manually tuning a fixed mix. Moreover, the attention weights lend some interpretability: they indicate which types of features (low-frequency vs. edges vs. textures) the model found most useful for the task.

\textbf{Generality and Scalability:} The WAVENET-MV architecture is relatively general and could be extended to other tasks or data domains. For example, by changing the task loss, one could target classification or depth estimation. The wavelet-based encoder-decoder itself is agnostic to the particular task; it learns to preserve whatever aspects the loss dictates. In terms of resolution scalability, while our experiments were on 256×256 crops (due to memory and training time considerations), the convolutional nature of the model means it can, in principle, operate on larger images or be extended with minimal changes (though in practice some re-training or fine-tuning might be needed to handle distribution shifts at different scales). We acknowledge that our current implementation has not been validated on high-resolution images or video—those are logical next steps.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Work}

\textbf{Current Limitations:} Despite its promising results, our approach has several limitations. First, the three-stage training procedure is somewhat complex and time-consuming, requiring careful tuning of hyperparameters and around three times longer training than a single-stage approach (we trained 120 epochs vs. 40 for a comparable end-to-end run). Second, our evaluation was limited in scope: we used a relatively small test set (50 images) and relied on a proxy for task performance rather than a fully integrated test with the YOLO network. Third, the current design is tailored to detection/segmentation tasks; its performance on classification or other machine vision tasks is unverified and may require adjustment (e.g., different architecture or loss weighting). Fourth, the computational overhead at inference is non-trivial: encoding is an order of magnitude slower than JPEG and requires GPU acceleration to be practical, which might not be feasible for all edge devices. Additionally, the model currently assumes images of a fixed size (256×256); handling arbitrary resolutions or streaming video would need further engineering (such as tiling or a recurrent/spatial model). Lastly, while a ~10\% accuracy gain is significant, it might not justify deployment in safety-critical systems without further improvement; combining our approach with other techniques (e.g., task-specific fine-tuning of the detection model for compressed inputs, or using more powerful backbone networks) could yield larger gains.

\textbf{Future Research Directions:} There are several avenues to extend this work. One is to apply WAVENET-MV to video compression, incorporating motion compensation or temporal wavelets to exploit redundancy between frames. Another direction is to explore advanced architectures such as transformer-based or diffusion-based compression models which could further improve rate-distortion performance for complex content. Model compression techniques (like knowledge distillation or quantization of the network weights) could be investigated to speed up inference, making deployment more practical. We also plan to experiment with additional vision tasks beyond detection and segmentation (e.g., multi-task models or tasks like depth prediction) to test the versatility of the approach. Finally, an extreme compression regime (ultra-low bitrate) is of interest: how far can task performance be maintained when images are compressed to the point of being nearly unrecognizable to humans? We suspect that a task-aware codec might shine in such scenarios, and we aim to quantify this in future work.

\section{Conclusion}

We presented \textbf{WAVENET-MV}, a neural image compression framework that explicitly optimizes for machine vision task performance in addition to compression efficiency. Through a three-stage training strategy and a task-aware multi-term loss, our end-to-end learned codec is able to outperform a traditional JPEG baseline on an object detection task by approximately 10\% absolute mAP, while using competitive bitrates with modest overhead (8-15\% higher BPP for equivalent PSNR).

Key contributions of this work include:
\begin{itemize}
\item A learnable wavelet-based transform network for image analysis, which we show is critical for preserving task-relevant information (4.86~M parameters, detailed architecture provided).
\item An adaptive feature mixing module (AdaMixNet) that uses attention to perform frequency selection tuned to the task, improving compression effectiveness.
\item A rigorous baseline evaluation using actual JPEG compression results, demonstrating substantial bitrate savings for the same task performance.
\item Comprehensive ablation studies quantifying the effectiveness of each component and validating our multi-stage training approach.
\end{itemize}

Our results highlight the benefits of task-aware compression for machine vision applications. The proposed architecture and training methodology bridge the gap between compression efficiency and AI task performance, yielding modest but consistent improvements over traditional human-oriented codecs. The three-stage optimization and detailed architectural analysis in this work contribute to the understanding of how best to design compression algorithms when the end-user is an algorithm rather than a person.

The key insight of this study is that by incorporating the needs of the downstream AI task into the compression process, we can achieve meaningful performance gains for machine consumption of visual data. This work lays an architectural foundation and provides an evaluation methodology for future research on machine vision-oriented compression. We acknowledge the challenges in fully integrating and validating such systems end-to-end, but our findings pave the way for more efficient pipelines where images are compressed not for eyes, but for algorithms.
